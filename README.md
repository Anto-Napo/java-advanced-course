## Misc

This is the following of the [java full course](https://github.com/Anto-Napo/java-full-course "Java full course").

You may want to install the plugin/extension *better comments*, so you can have a better view of the comments.

Parts that I'm working on are updated on a specific branch before they are merged on the main one after being finished. Don't forget to check them!

If you use Intellij, and it doesn't let you run the file, go in the gradle tab (right panel) and press refresh.
